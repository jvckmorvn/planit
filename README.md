## Introduction
Welcome to our group events planner! Here's how it works: create an account on the app. You can then create any number of groups containing various combinations of other users on the app. Each member of a given group can create or delete events within that group, and all group members can also vote on their preferred date for a particular group event. The events calendar for that group will display everyone's votes for each event as a sort of 'heat map', with darker shades of the event's colour representing the more popular dates for that event. At any point, the creator of an event has the ability to 'lock' it, at which point the event becomes fixed on the date that received the most votes and can no longer be changed. No more faffing around in group chats - you're welcome!
